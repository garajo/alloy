        ALLOY - KSF GUI HTML5 Component and Styling Library
    </header>
    <div>
        This module contains all commonly used KSF GUI HTML5 components with the official CARANU styling. Styling is pure HTML &
        CSS without any behavior to the components. (No Javascript). CSS styling is based on the SCSS (Sassy CSS) syntax
        and the *.scss style sheets are compiled to *.css files using the node-sass npm module. In addition to pure CSS,
        Foundation for Sites is used as the starting point for the styling. Also, included are few examples demonstrating
        the usage of the components or styles (alone) in individual applications. Initial release of the Alloy library targets
        only the styling of various HTML5 elements as per the Caranu guidelines and does not include any reusable HTML5 components
        as a whole. Future releases would add new components to the library.
