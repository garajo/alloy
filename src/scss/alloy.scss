// This alloy.scss file constitutes the default (non customized) versions of Alloy
// If a consuming app wants to contribute/add to the themeing/color model
// with its own custom styles and color for its own app specific custom controls
// or experience then it should follow the instructions in the alloy_customize_template.scss file

// Given the need to support default alloy and customized alloy abstracted common things (mostly foundation settings stuff) into a common file
@import 'alloy_base';

// Since this is the default (non customized) alloy pull in the alloy dark theme and all of its glory
@import 'themes/_dark.scss'; 

body {
   &.light {

        // Pull in Alloy light theme but wrap it here in its body/.light combo. This allows for the customized version of Alloy light to be imported without the body/light combo
        @import 'themes/_light.scss'; 
   }
